#Study Design
The Human Activity Recognition database (HAR) was built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

The full description of data can be found here:

The har_means.txt is a "long form" dataset with aggregate means of all the "mean" and "std" measures by subject and by activity, with each measure/variable represented as a row.

#Code Book

* subject: a number representing the individual in the study
